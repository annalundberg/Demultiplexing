# Demultiplexing

This is an algorithm for demultiplexing sequence reads/indexes.

We need to determine if the indexes match per read. One sequence file is forward reads, the other is reverse. The reads appear in a consistent order between files. We need to filter the reads so that each index gets a file of forward reads and one of reverse reads. Since we donâ€™t know which file has forward and which has reverse, we will arbitrarily assign. Reads with unclear indexes will be thrown into the pair of files with unknown indexes.


## Output: 
File names of all files created (2 files per index (forward and reverse) and 2 files of reads with unclear indexes), integer of properly matched indexes and float percentage of index hopping observed.'''
